Very simple BMI calculator webapp. This was my first personal project while learning JavaScript. 

Link: https://ziya-sharifli.github.io/BMI-Calculator/

How to use:

Enter your age (which doesn't do anything for now), enter weight and height. You have to enter your height in this format (x.xx cm), for example (1.82cm).

TODO:

~~DONE. Make the styling better, center the whole app.~~
1. Add imperial option and not just metric.
2. Add an error message when metric height is typed in wrong format.
3. Add some animations.
4. Add healthy/unhealthy meter/message.
